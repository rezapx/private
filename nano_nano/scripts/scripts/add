# Note the input to this will probably come from `cut`,
# so a couple of tips on cut:
#   1. columns from `ls -l` are delimited by a variable
#      number of spaces. You can ignore this fact by
#      squeezing said spaces with a `tr -s ' '` before
#      you input to cut -d' '. Generally find is much
#      better for printing inode info than ls.
#   2. You should probably always use the -s option to
#      cut, so that it doesn't output lines that do not
#      contain the delimiter

tr -cd '[.\n0-9]' |   # only leave numbers
sed '/^$/d' |         # delete any blank lines

#method 1
(tr '\n' +; echo 0) |
bc                     # \n --> +

#method 2
#tr '\n' +             # \n --> +
#sed 's/+$/\
#/' |                  # last + --> \n
#bc

#method 3

#echo 0
#sed 's/\(.\)$/\1+/'    # \n --> +\n

#dc #5 times slower!

#method 4
#awk '{s+=$0} END {print s}'
